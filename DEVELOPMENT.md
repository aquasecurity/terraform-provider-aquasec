# Terraform Provider Scaffolding

This repository is a *template* for a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) provider. It is intended as a starting point for creating Terraform providers, containing:

 - A resource, and a data source (`internal/provider/`),
 - Examples (`examples/`) and generated documentation (`docs/`),
 - Miscellanious meta files.

These files contain boilerplate code that you will need to edit to create your own Terraform provider. A full guide to creating Terraform providers can be found at [Writing Custom Providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html).

Please see the [GitHub template repository documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for how to create a new repository from this template on GitHub.

Once you've written your provider, you'll want to [publish it on the Terraform Registry](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html) so that others can use it.


## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.15

## Build the Aquasec Provider

The Aquasec Terraform provider can be pulled from the [Hashicorp registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aquasecurity/aquasec/latest) as for the included examples in this repository.

As an alternative, and for development purposes, you can build the provider locally with the following instructions.

**Clone the repo**

Clone the repository locally and switch to the version you want to try
```
git clone https://github.com/aquasecurity/terraform-provider-aquasec.git

cd terraform-provider-aquasec

git checkout v0.8.9
```

**Build the provider**
```
go build
```

The last command will compile the Terraform Provider and generate a `terraform-provider-aquasec` binary in your local directory.

**Install the provider**

After a successful build, the generated binary will need to be installed into the folder containing the Terraform resources.

We'll use here the [example Terraform resources](examples/resources/main.tf) provided in this repo.

```
mkdir -p examples/resources/.terraform/plugins/terraform-provider-aquasec/aquasec/aquasec/0.8.9/darwin_amd64/

mv terraform-provider-aquasec examples/resources/.terraform/plugins/terraform-provider-aquasec/aquasec/aquasec/0.8.9/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-aquasec
```
Make sure to replace the version `0.8.9` and the architecture `darwin_amd64` in the path as relevant for your system.

**Terraform configuration**

In order to test the provider installed locally, the provider block will have to include the path to the current binary, as in the following example
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aquasec = {
      version = "0.8.9"
      source  = "terraform-provider-aquasec/aquasec/aquasec"
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Aquasec Terraform Provider

The following instructions will let you test the provider. If you built a localy copy of it please make sure to follow the instruction above and replace the provider definition in the example resources.

```
cd examples/resources

terraform init
```

Finally, make sure to replace the Aqua credentials and URL in the `provider` block and start trying out the different resources as provided in the example file.

```
provider "aquasec" {
  username = "admin"
  aqua_url = "https://aquaurl.com"
  password = "@password"
}
```

## Documentation generation

This will allow you to locally generate updates to the documentation (found in the `docs` directory).
```sh
go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/cmd/tfplugindocs # check source url in tools/tools.go
```
Ensure `GOBIN` is set correctly, or that the installed `tfplugindocs` tool is available on your `PATH`.
```sh
which tfplugindocs # if not found, check in your $GOPATH/bin/tfplugindocs
```

Ensure you are in the root directory of the project, and run
```sh
tfplugindocs generate
```

The tool will analyse the source code, and automatically build a schema map, with `Description` fields allowing for
some additional context to be provided. It will also iterate through template files in `templates/`, and example code for
each resource can be provided at `examples/resources/[full resource name]/resource.tf`. Similarly, for data sources,
the location is `examples/data-sources/[full data source name]/data-source.tf`.

The output in the docs directory is what gets published on https://registry.terraform.io. Please take care to provide
quality documentation and examples of resources and data sources developed for the provider.
