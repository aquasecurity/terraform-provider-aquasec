# Aquasec Provider

Use the Aquasec provider to interact with the many resources in the Aqua platform. 
You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

~> **WARNING** It is recommended to create a custom user, role and permission set 
(with API Only permissions), and use this user for performing operations from Terraform.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aquasec = {
      version = "0.8.34"
      source  = "aquasecurity/aquasec"
    }
  }
}

provider "aquasec" {
  username = "IaC"                 // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_USER
  aqua_url = "https://aquaurl.com" // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_URL
  password = "@password"           // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_PASSWORD

  // If you are using unverifiable certificates (e.g. self-signed) you may need to disable certificate verification
  verify_tls = false // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_TLS_VERIFY

  // Alternatively, you can provide these configurations from a config file, and configure the provider as below
  // config_path = '/path/to/tf.config' // defaults to '~/.aqua/tf.config' -- Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_CONFIG
}
```
