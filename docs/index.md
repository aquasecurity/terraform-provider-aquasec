# Aquasec Provider

Use the Aquasec provider to interact with the many resources in the Aqua platform. 
You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

~> **WARNING** It is recommended to create a custom user, role and permission set 
(with API Only permissions), and use this user for performing operations from Terraform.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aquasec = {
      version = "0.13.0"
      source  = "aquasecurity/aquasec"
    }
  }
}

provider "aquasec" {
  username = "IaC"                 // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_USER
  aqua_url = "https://aquaurl.com" // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_URL
  password = "@password"           // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_PASSWORD

  // If you are using unverifiable certificates (e.g. self-signed) you may need to disable certificate verification
  verify_tls = false // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_TLS_VERIFY

  // Alternatively, you can provide these configurations from a config file, and configure the provider as below
  // config_path = '/path/to/tf.config' // defaults to '~/.aquasec/tf.config' -- Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_CONFIG
  // validate = false // Skip provider credential validation

  //Alternatively, you can use API key authentication as below instead of username/password authentication.
  aqua_api_key      = var.aquasec_api_key    // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_API
  aqua_api_secret   = var.aquasec_api_secret // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_SECRET
  validity          = 240                    // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_TOKEN_VALIDITY
  allowed_endpoints = ["ANY"]                // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_ALLOWED_ENDPOINTS
  csp_roles         = ["Admin"]              // Alternatively sourced from $AQUA_CSP_ROLES
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `allowed_endpoints` (List of String) API methods the token has access to
- `aqua_api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for authentication. If set, API key mode is used instead of token-based auth.
- `aqua_api_secret` (String, Sensitive) Shared secret for API key HMAC signing.
- `aqua_url` (String) This is the base URL of your Aqua instance. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_URL` environment variable.
- `ca_certificate_path` (String) This is the file path for server CA certificates if they are not available on the host OS. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_CA_CERT_PATH` environment variable.
- `config_path` (String) This is the file path for Aqua provider configuration. The default configuration path is `~/.aquasec/tf.config`. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_CONFIG` environment variable.
- `csp_roles` (List of String)
- `password` (String, Sensitive) This is the password that should be used to make the connection. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `username` (String, Sensitive) This is the user id that should be used to make the connection. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_USER` environment variable.
- `validate` (Boolean) Skip provider credential validation when set to false.
- `validity` (Number) Lifetime of the token, in minutes. Set between 1 and 1500. Once the token expires, need to generate a new one
- `verify_tls` (Boolean) If true, server tls certificates will be verified by the client before making a connection. Defaults to true. Can alternatively be sourced from the `AQUA_TLS_VERIFY` environment variable.
